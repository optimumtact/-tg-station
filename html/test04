<h5>06.02.2011, r979</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Jesus christ it's a new map what the fuck
	<LI>Just kidding, it's only minor changes to medbay/mechbay/cybernetics/R&amp;D/toxins/robotics/chapel/theatre
	<LI>Okay so there's too many changes to list completely, but basically: toxins/R&amp;D/virology/xenobiology are south <i>through</i> medbay; robotics/cybernetics/mechbay are where toxins used to be, the theatre and chapel are above medbay.
	<LI>Theatre is a new place for the Clown and Mime to play, there are some costumes available, a stage and backstage, and seating for the audience.
	<LI>R&amp;D and Toxins have been combined together. R&amp;D is still work in progress. You need to head south through medbay to get there.
	<LI>Medbay has been re-arranged slightly. Honestly, it's nothing, I bet you won't even notice anything different. There's also a new surgery suite, complete with pre-op and post-op rooms. 
	<LI>Virology's been rearranged, but it is mostly in the same place still.
	<LI>Xenobiology is work in progress. [There's some fun stuff still being coded]
	<LI>The Chapel is now to the north. You'll probably be thinking something like "Goddamn, this place is fucking huge", but it's actually smaller than the previous chapel.
	<LI>Robotics and related stuff is also work in progress - however, everything needed for making borgs is there. Note: de-braining will now be done by surgeons in medbay, rather than roboticists in robotics, in case you're wondering where your optable went.
	<LI>I added color-coded pipes in the areas I was working on. Red pipes run from air siphons and feed into the waste loop; blue pipes run from air vents and pump whatever atmos is set to pump. Yeah, there's TWO pipe networks on the station, who knew? Well, some of you probably did, but I didn't!
	<LI>Please bring all complaints/ideas/suggestions/bugfixes to: <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=14971#p14971">This awesome thread on our forums</a>
	<LI>This update brought to you by: veyveyr and Rookie, with help from friends! [Now you know who to strangle, please be gentle q_q]
</ul>

<h5>05.02.2011, r968</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>This really needs to be updated more often.
	<LI>Various map updates have been applied with many more to come. Expect overhauls! 
	<LI>Mining system nearing completion.
	<LI>Massive overhaul to the electricity systems, the way singularity makes power, and various related functions.
	<LI>Mime spawns with White Gloves instead of Latex Gloves (apparently there's a difference!)
	<LI>A new event has been- CLANG! What the fuck was that?
	<LI>Ion storm laws should be much more interesting.
	<LI>Security reports should no longer list traitor heads/AIs as possible revs/cultists, nor should nuke operatives ever get named for anything.
	<LI>Pens are much more versatile and user friendly.
	<LI>Mech building is rapidly on its way! Ripleys can be built, consult your quartermasters.
	<LI>Traitors now have several new things they can steal.
	<LI>Some surgeries coded to accompany the new operating room and surgery tools.
	<LI>Research and Design is continuing development and should be rolled out shortly.
	<LI>Various sprites added, tweaked, scrapped and fixed.
</ul>

	<LI>Alium Overhaul. Divided into multiple castes with distinct abilities.
	<LI>New AI Modules: The goody two-shoes P.A.L.A.D.I.N. module and it's evil twin T.Y.R.A.N.T. Only the former actually spawns on the station.

	<li>Engine Monitor PDA app is now Power Monitor PDA app, and actually works.</li>
	<li>AI State Laws verb now allows the AI to choose which laws to state, in case of traitor AIs or laws ordering it not to state them.  Hopefully this will cut down on 'OMG THE AI IS COPYING AND PASTING' metagaming.</li>
	<li>Power Monitor circuitboard isn't mislabeled as Mass Driver Control any more.</li>
	<li><strong>Traitor and Rev-head clowns lose the clumsiness gene</strong> - this should make trying to flash people in Rev mode less of an exercise in frustration.</li>

	<li>'Purge' AI module added - purges ALL laws (except for law 0). Will probably change this to a Syndicate only item</li>
	<li>Cyborgs now spawn with a power cell. Should prevent stupid cyborg deaths (and also pave the way for starting as a cyborg once more bugs are fixed)</li>
</ul>
