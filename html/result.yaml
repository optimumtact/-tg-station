      units. Simply upload your AI to the exosuit's internal computer via the InteliCard
      device. Per safety regulations, the exosuit must have maintenance protocols

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -
      15 AP = 65 Melee).'

      10.

      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,

      on your head.

      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

      suicide has been fixed.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using
      the speed potion on an item of clothing will paint it red and remove its slowdown.
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.

      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.

      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.

  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the

  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).

      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,

      other ghosts appear to you.

      to help ensure they do not die during the link.
  Shadowlight213:
  - bugfix: Cleanbot and floorbot scanning has greatly improved. they should prioritize
      areas next to them, as well as resolve themselves stacking on the same tiles.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Kinetic accelerators only require one hand to be fired, as before
  - rscdel: Kinetic accelerators recharge time is multiplied by the number of KAs
      that person is carrying.
  - rscdel: Kinetic accelerators lose their charge quickly if not equipped or being
      held
  - rscadd: Kinetic accelerator modkits (made at R&D or your local Free Golem ship)
      overcome these flaws
2016-05-19:
  Razharas:
  - rscadd: HE pipes once again work in space and in lava.
  - rscadd: Space cools down station air again
2016-05-20:
  KorPhaeron:
  - rscadd: The HoS now has a pinpointer, the Warden now has his door remote.
  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has begun to research BZ, a hallucinogenic gas. We trust you
      will use it responsibly.
  - rscadd: BZ causes hallucinations once breathed in and, at high doses, has a chance
      of doing brain damage.
  - rscadd: BZ is known to cause unusual stasis-like behavior in the slime species.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Neurotoxin spit can be used as makeshift space propulsion

  Iamsaltball:
  - rscadd: Heads of Staff now have basic Maint. access.
  NicholasM10:
  - rscadd: The chef can now make Khinkali and Khachapuri
  coiax:
  - rscdel: NOBREATH species (golems, skeletons, abductors, ash walkers, zombies)
      no longer have or require lungs. They no longer take suffocation/oxyloss damage,
      cannot give CPR and cannot benefit from CPR. Instead of suffocation damage,
      during crit they take gradual brute damage.
  - rscdel: NOBLOOD (golems, skeletons, abductors, slimepeople, plasmamen) species
      no longer have or require hearts.
  - tweak: NOBREATH species that require hearts still take damage from heart attacks,
      as their tissues die and the lack of circulation causes toxins to build up.
  - rscdel: NOHUNGER (plasmamen, skeletons) species no longer have appendixes.
  coiax, OPDingo:
  - tweak: Renamed and reskinned legion's heart to legion's soul to avoid confusion;
      it is not a substitute heart, it is a supplemental chest organ.
  - rscadd: Legion's souls are now more obviously inert when becoming inert.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Wetness updates less often.
  - rscadd: Wetness now stacks. Spraying lube over a tile that already has lube, will
      make the lube take longer to dry. Likewise, dumping 100 units of lube will take
      longer to dry than if only 10 units were dumped. (lube used to last just as
      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and
      you can't stack infinite lube.
  - tweak: Hotter temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly. At 100C, water
      will boil away instantly.
  - rscadd: About 5 seconds of wetness are removed from a tile for each unit of drying
      agent. Absorbant Galoshes remain the most effective method of drying, and dry
      tiles instantly regardless of wetness.
2016-05-22:

  - rscadd: Crayons and spraycans are now easier to use.
  - rscdel: Centcom announce due to budget cuts their supplier of rainbow crayons
      has been forced to use more... exotic chemicals. Please do not ingest your standard
      issue crayon.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: 'Peacekeeper borgs: Security borgs but without any stuns or restraints!
      Modules: Harm Alarm, Cookie Dispenser, Energy Bola Launcher, Peace Injector
      that confuses living things, and a weak holobarrier projector! It also comes
      with the ability to hug.'
  - rscadd: 'Cookie Synthesizer: Self recharging RCD that prints out cookies!'
  - tweak: Nanotrasen scientists have added a hugging module to medical and peacekeeper
      cyborgs to boost emotions during human-cyborg interaction.

  - bugfix: Fixes bug where bolt of change to laughter demon would not release its
      friends.
  - bugfix: Fixes bug where bolt of change to morphling would not release its contents.
  - bugfix: Fixes bug where bolt of change transforming someone into a drone would
      not give them hacked laws and vision.
  - bugfix: Blobbernauts created by a staff of change are now "independent" and will
      not decay if seperated from a blob or missing a factory.
  - rscadd: Independent blobbernauts added to gold slime core spawn pool.
  - rscadd: Medical scanners now inform the user if the dead subject is within the
      (currently) 120 second defib window.
  - rscadd: Ghosts now have the "Restore Character Name" verb, which will set their
      ghost appearance and dead chat name to their character preferences.
  - bugfix: Mob spawners now give any generated names to the mind of the spawned mob,
      meaning ghosts will have the name they had in life.
  - bugfix: Fixes interaction with envy's knife and lavaland spawns.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug where swarmers teleporting humans would incorrectly display
      a visible message about restraints breaking.
  - rscdel: Emagging the emergency shuttle computer with less than ten seconds until
      launch no longer gives additional time.
  - rscadd: The emergency shuttle computer now reads the ID in your ID slot, rather
      than your hand.
2016-05-27:
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Gatling gun removed from R&D for pressing ceremonial reasons.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but
      they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until
      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.
  - tweak: Someone pulling a restrained mob now swap position with them instead of
      getting blocked by the mob, unable to even push them.
2016-05-29:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: The CE, RD, and CMO have been issued megaphones.
  Paprika, Crystalwarrior, Korphaeron and Bawhoppen:

  - bugfix: Function Call now works as intended.
  - bugfix: Break Will now works as intended.

      the best and <strike>most</strike> mostly bugfree feature on /tg/.

  - bugfix: Fixes bug where the wisp was unable to be recalled to the lantern.
  xxalpha:
  - rscdel: Engineering, CE and Atmos hardsuits no longer have in-built jetpacks.

  CoreOverload:
  - rscadd: 'Cleanbot software was updated to version 1.2, improving pathfinding and
      adding two new cleaning options: "Clean Trash" and "Exterminate Pests".'
  - experiment: New cleaning options are still experimental and disabled by default.
  Kiazusho:
  - bugfix: Changeling organic suit and chitin armor can be toggled off once again.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The Japanese Animes button is back,
  - rscadd: 'The chaplain has three new weapons: The possessed blade, the extra-dimensional
      blade, and the nautical energy sword. The former has a new power, the latter
      two are normal sword reskins.'
  - rscadd: The chapel mass driver has been buffed.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Zombies can no longer be butchered
  - rscadd: If you encounter an infectious zombie, be cautious, its claws will infect
      you, and on death you will rise with them. If you manage to kill the beast,
      you can remove the corruption from its brain via surgery, or just chop off the
      head to stop it coming back.
  - rscadd: Adds some stock computers and lavaland to Birdboat Station.
  - bugfix: Free Golem scientists have proved that as beings made out of stone, golems
      are immune to all electrical discharges, including the tesla.

  Lati:
  - rscadd: R&D required levels and origin tech levels have been rebalanced
  - experiment: Overall, items buildable in R&D have lower tech levels and items in
      other departments have their tech levels raised. Remember to use science goggles
      to see tech levels of items!
  - tweak: There are now level gates at high levels. R&D scientists will need help
      from others to get past these level gates.
  - tweak: Other departments such as hydroponics and genetics will be important to
      R&D's progress now and xenobio, mining and cargo are more important than before
  - tweak: Efficiency upgrades are back in R&D machines and tweaked to be less powerful
      in autolathes
  - rscdel: Reliability has been removed from all items
  - bugfix: Most bugs in R&D machines should be fixed
  PKPenguin321 & Nienhaus:
  - rscadd: Letterman jackets are now available from the ClothesMate.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: The bar has seen a redesign.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Clone pods now notify the medical channel on a successful clone. They
      also notify the medical channel if the clone dies or is horribly mutilated;
      but not if it is ejected early by authorised medical personnel.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now are more capable of cloning humanoid species that do
      not breathe.
  - bugfix: You can only be damaged once by a shuttle's arrival. It is still unpleasant
      to be in the path of one though; try to avoid it.
  - rscadd: Adds Asteroid emergency shuttle to shuttle templates. It is a very oddly
      shaped one though, it might not be compatible with all stations.
  - rscdel: The Chaplain soulshard can only turn a body into a shade once. A released
      shade can still be reabsorbed by the stone to heal it.
  - rscadd: The shuttle manipulator now has a Fast Travel button, for those admins
      that really want a shuttle to get to where its going FAST.
2016-06-04:
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: fixes see_darkness improperly hiding ghosts in certain cases.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables.
  - tweak: Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take
      heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted
      by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze.
  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing
      a normal airlock or from Ratvar.
  - rscadd: Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form
      of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants.
  - bugfix: Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors.
  - bugfix: Servants are now deconverted properly.
  coiax:
  - bugfix: The cloning pod now sounds robotic on the radio.
  - rscadd: For extra observer drama, ghosts can now visibly see the countdown of
      syndicate bombs, nuclear devices, cloning pods, gang dominators and AI doomsday
      devices.
2016-06-05:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork structures can be damaged by projectiles and simple animals,
      and will actually drop debris when destroyed.
  - rscadd: AIs and Cyborgs that serve Ratvar can control clockwork airlocks and clockwork
      windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles,
      and windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards
      to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill,
      in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can replace clockwork floors with clockwork
      walls and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Ratvar will convert windoors, tables, and computers in addition to everything
      else.
  - tweak: Ratvar now moves around much faster.
  - rscadd: Ratvar and Nar-Sie will break each other's objects.
  - tweak: The blind eye from a broken ocular warden now serves as a belligerent eye
      instead of as replicant alloy. The pinion lock from a deconstructed clockwork
      airlock now serves as a vanguard cogwheel instead of as replicant alloy.
  - rscadd: Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall
      gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards
      when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.
  - bugfix: Fixed Nar-Sie wandering while battling Ratvar.
  - bugfix: Ratvarian Spears now last for the proper 5 minute duration.
  - bugfix: Servant communication now has ghost follow links.
  - imageadd: New sigil sprites, courtesy Skowron.
  - imageadd: Sigils of Transgression have a visual effect when stunning a target.
  - imageadd: Clockwork spears now have a visual effect when breaking.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: The CMO's medical HUD implant now comes with a one-use autoimplanter for
      ease of use.
  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.
  - bugfix: Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but
      not when it actually spawns).
  - tweak: Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is
      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.
2016-06-08:
  Cruix:
  - bugfix: Changelings no longer lose the regenerate ability if they respect while
      in regenerative stasis.
  Fox McCloud:
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor critical reactions not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor item cloning not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor producing coffee vending machines instead of coffe
      cups
  - tweak: Experimentor can only clone critical reaction items instead of anything
      with an origin tech
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has approved the Hyper-Kenetic Accelerator upgrade for cyborg
      mining modules.
  - tweak: Each of the heads' ID computers are now themed for their department!
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly more health and move faster, but slow down
      temporarily when taking damage. Also they can move in space now.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The clown will play a sad trombone noise upon death.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: You can now emag chemical dispensers, such as the ones in chemistry or
      the bar, to unlock illegal chemicals.
