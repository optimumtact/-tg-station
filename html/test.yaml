      Newspapers are now fully working, sorry for that. Some minor icon bugs fixed.
      Now I''m free to work on the contest prizes :3</font>'

  - unknown: !!python/unicode 'What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan
      series might find them familiar. Basically, they''re terminals connected to
      a station-wide news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own
      (one per identified user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people
      or, if you want the channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked
      to you), while others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals
      or a printed newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time
      of printing.'
  - unknown: !!python/unicode 'About censorship: You can censor channels and feed
      stories through Security casters, found in the HoS''es office and the Bridge.
      Alternatively, if you want a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark
      it with a D-Notice which will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable
      for the duration it is in effect. If you''ve got the access, of course.'
  - unknown: !!python/unicode 'Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more
      as an additional Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and
      coffee from the machines, read station rumors when you''re manning your desk,
      be a station adventurer or journalist with your very own network journal!'
  - unknown: !!python/unicode 'I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine,
      though. I removed all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content,
      so you might end up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to
      the admins.'
  - unknown: !!python/unicode "Finally, due to the removal of the enforced \"Channel\"\
      \ string, it's recommended to name your channels properly (\"Station Paranormal\
      \ Activity Channel\" instead of \"Station Paranormal Activity\", for example\"\
      )\n\n  "
