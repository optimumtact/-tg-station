  <li><b>Sieve updated:</b>
  <ul>	
	<li>This stuff is actually already implemented, it just didn't make it to the changelog</li>
	<li>Firefighter Mech - A reinforced Ripley that is more resistant to better cope with fires, simply look in the Ripley Contruction manual for instructions.</li>
	<li>Mech contruction now has sounds for each step, not just 1/4 of them.</li>
	<li>Mech Fabricators are fixed, Manual Sync now works and certain reseach will reduce the time needed to build components.</li>
	<li>Added special flaps to the mining station that disallow air-flow, removing the need to shuffle Ore Boxes through the Airlocks.</li>
	<li>Each outpost has it's own system for the conveyors so they won't interfere with each other.</li>
	<li>Powercell chargers have been buffed so now higher capacity cells are actually useable.</li>
	<li>A diamond mech drill has been added. While it isn't any stronger than the standard drill, it is much faster.</li>

  <ul>	
	<li><font face="terminal"><b>UPDATE ON THE UPDATE</b>: Newspapers are now fully working, sorry for that. Some minor icon bugs fixed. Now I'm free to work on the contest prizes :3</FONT></li>
	<li><b><font color="red">Newscasters are now LIVE!</font></b> Bug reports, suggestions for extra uses, tears etc go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=3005" target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
	<li>What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.</li>
	<li>About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security casters, found in the HoS'es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in effect. If you've got the access, of course.</li>
	<li>Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer or journalist with your very own network journal!</li>
	<li>I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.</li>
	<li>Finally, due to the removal of the enforced "Channel" string, it's recommended to name your channels properly ("Station Paranormal Activity Channel" instead of "Station Paranormal Activity", for example")

	<li><b>The radio overhaul 'Telecommunications' is now LIVE.</b> Please submit any opinions/feedback in the forums and check the wiki article on Telecommunications for some more info for the curious.</li>
	<li>The AI satellite has been replaced with a communications satellite. You can get there via teleporter or space, just like the AI satellite. I highly recommend not bum-rushing the new satellite, as you may be killed if you don't have access. It's a very secure place.</li>
	<li>Once a human's toxicity level reaches a certain point, they begin throwing up. This is a natural, but overall ineffective method of purging toxins from the body.</li>
	<li>You can now travel Z-levels in Nuclear Emergency mode (the nuke disk is still bound to the station). This means the nuclear agents can and probably will fly off into space to blow up the comm satellite and shut down communications.</li>

  <ul>	
	<li>Reworked exosuit internal atmospherics (the situation when exosuit is set to take air from internal tank, otherwise cabin air = location air): 
		<ul>
			<li>If current cabin presure is lower than &amp;quot;tank output pressure&amp;quot;, the air will be taken from internal tank (if possible), to equalize cabin pressure to &amp;quot;tank output pressure&amp;quot;</li>
			<li>If current cabin presure is higher than &amp;quot;tank output pressure&amp;quot;, the air will be siphoned from cabin to location until cabin pressure is equal to &amp;quot;tank output pressure&amp;quot;</li>
			<li>Tank air is not altered in any way even if it's overheated or overpressured - connect exosuit to atmos connector port to vent it</li>
			<li>&amp;quot;Tank output pressure&amp;quot; can be set through Maintenance window - Initiate maintenance protocol to get the option</li>

    <li>Stunglove overhaul: part one. Stun gloves are now made by wiring a pair of gloves, and then attaching a battery- this shows up on the object sprite, but not on your character. Stungloves use 2500 charge per stun! This means that some low capacity batteries will make <i>useless</i> stungloves. To get your old inconspicous gloves back, simply cut away the wire and battery. <font color='red'>Note that insulated gloves lose their insulation when you wire them up!</font> <b>Yet to come:</b> stungloves taking extra damage from shocked doors.</li>

	<li>Tweaked Metroids a bit; they are slightly more aggressive and become hungrier faster. To compensate, they now move slightly slower.</li>

		<li>A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.</li>
		<li>The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.</li>
		<li>Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.</li>
		<li>EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look, I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended to rearrange my half assed shit.</li>
		<li>Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you can annoy the janitor even more!</li>

<b><font color='blue'>6 May 2011, AMURRICA FUCK YEAH day - Dangercon update</font></b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Agouri and Erro updated(I'm in the DangerCon team now, nyoro~n :3)</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.</li>
		<li>Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal is up on the wiki.</li>
		<li>Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery for heavy injury.</li>
		<li>Just kidding</li>
		<li>Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around the station, thank Nanotransen for that.</li>
		<li>Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system, so while it's <u><font color='red'>FUCKING ROBUST</u></font> you need to wield it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.</li>
		<li>Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. 
		<li>A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object in your hand.<li>
		<li><b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher, attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans for our little friend.
		<li><u>Sprite kudos go to: Cheridan for most of them, Khodoque for the fantastic fireaxe head. I merged those two. Also thanks to matty and Arcalane for giving it a shot.</u></li>
		<li><font size = '2'><i>Has the piano got TOO annoying? Try the fire axe...</font size></i></li>
		<li>Oh, and tou can now construct Light floors! To do it: Use wires on glass, then metal on the produced assembly, then place it on an uncovered floor like you would when replacing broken floor tiles. To deconstruct: Crowbar on light floor, use crowbar on produced assembly to remove metal, wirecutters to seperate the wires from the glass. Sprites by delicious Hempuli.</li>
		<li>Got something to bitch about? Got a bug to report? Want to create drama? Did the clown destroy your piano while you were playing an amazing space remix of the moonlight sonata? Give it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=1543">here</a>
